# freeCodeCamp-Front End Libraries Certification

#### For me, this was an entirely new configuration. Here I studied the fundamentals of a number of the well-known front-end frameworks and technologies, including Bootstrap, JQuery, SASS, React JS, and Redux. During this certification they gave me modules and tasks to complete while they explained each topic to me, and in the conclusion, I was given 5 projects to complete in order to earn the certificate. These projects were as follows:
  - Random Quote Machine
  - Markdown Previewer
  - Drum Machine
  - JavaScript Calculator
  - 25 + 5 Clock

#### 1. Random Quote Machine: This webpage is designed to display random quotes. Every time the "New Quote" button is hit, these random quotes are displayed, and as soon as this button is pressed, the page's background colour and the buttons' colours change at random. The page also has two additional buttons, one for copying the quotes and the other for posting them as a tweet directly to Twitter.<br><br>Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br><br>View it here: https://codepen.io/saivalpadasu/full/poZoapN
